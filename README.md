Descriptoin of the project

The project aims to use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the Mitochondrial DNA Transcription. There are 37 mt-genes in human mitochondria DNA, and we will focus on the transcription of the 13 protein coding genes and the 2 rRNAs. 

Transcription of the genes can be initiated either on the light strand or on the heavy strand. On the light strand, it will only replicate one protein-coding gene (ND6). On the heavy strand, it starts from replicating the two rRNAs, and has a chance to terminate right after that; otherwise, it will continue to replicate all the remaining 12 protein-coding genes. 

Meanwhile, the gene transcripts have a chance to degrade at time. The quantity of transcripts of each gene is subject to exponential decay, where the explicit decay coefficient is unknown. In the simulation, we will assume decay coefficients for the transcripts, and use the algorithm to solve for the stable status. 

About the codes
--

Use "Gene Data" notebook to read the raw data and apply the simulation. The final code segment will store the key results in a .pickle file. Remark: this file could be very large. 

The "Results" notebook can produce some stats plots based on the data in the .pickle file generated by "Gene Data". 

All key features are included in the two notebooks above, and the other notebooks are mostly used for testing. 

All codes are in Python 3.10.5.
